# IBM Quantum Challenge 2024
My answers from participating in IBM's Quantum Challenge 2024

## Labs: 

- [x] Lab 0: Welcome and Hello World
In this beginner lab, we focus on teaching you how to use the challenge notebooks, how to grade your work, and how to manage the general flow of setting up, running, and evaluating the results of your quantum code.
- [x] Lab 1: Introduction to Qiskit 1.0
Lab 1 is designed to introduce you to some of the new capabilities and functions of Qiskit 1.0. Through this lab you will learn how to set up quantum states using Qiskit, and how to implement an optimization algorithm using variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE).
- [x] Lab 2: Transpilation with Qiskit 1.0
In this lab, you will learn some key features of Qiskit 1.0's transpiler - the four pre-defined transpilation paths, the six stages of transpilation, and how to build your own transpiler pass manager. It will showcase the flexibility of Qiskit 1.0 transpiler and provide hands-on training. Also, you will be introduced to the Qiskit ecosystem and how to contribute with your own transpiler.
- [x] Lab 3: Whatâ€™s next - Sneak Preview of Upcoming Features
In this lab you get exclusive access to groundbreaking new features in development for the Qiskit stack. Lab 3 is split into separate notebooks, each highlighting a unique new tool. Explore and test these features, and see how they could enhance quantum development workflows.
Keep in mind that these features are in beta, so you may possibly encounter some bugs. Dive in, experiment fearlessly, and push the boundaries of what's possible in quantum computing.
- [x] Lab 4: Testing a Variational Quantum Classifier on a Real Backend
In this lab, you will learn how to build and train a simple Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) on an ideal backend using the Qiskit Patterns workflow. Once the VQC is trained, you will experience how the presence of noise has an impact on its performance. Finally, you will learn how to reduce the depth of the VQC and then run the resulting circuit on quantum hardware to see how error suppression and error mitigation techniques have an impact on the results.
